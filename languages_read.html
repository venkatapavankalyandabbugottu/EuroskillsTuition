                            Ancient learners seem to have started by reading, memorising and reciting little stories and
                            dialogues that provided basic vocabulary and grammar in naturalistic contexts. These texts
                            (and they seem to have always been coherent texts, never isolated sentences such as modern
                            learners often practise on) covered topics such as getting dressed in the morning (and how
                            to manage the slaves who helped with that task), going to school (and evading punishment for
                            not having been there yesterday), visiting a sick friend (and how to find an individual unit
                            in a Roman apartment block), trading insults (and how to concede a fight gracefully), or
                            getting a new job (a piece of cake if you have studied with me, an ancient teacher assured
                            his students mendaciously). The texts were presented bilingually in two narrow columns, the
                            language you were learning on the left and the one you already knew on the right, with the
                            columns matching line for line: each line was effectively a glossary, while each column was
                            a text.
                            <br>

                            Although the need to learn foreign languages is almost as old as human history itself, the
                            origins of modern language education are in the study and teaching of Latin in the 17th
                            century. In the Ancient Near East, Akkadian was the language of diplomacy, as in the Amarna
                            letters.[5] For many centuries, Latin had been the dominant language of education, commerce,
                            religion, and government in much of the Western world. By the end of the 16th century, it
                            had largely been displaced by French, Italian, and English. John Amos Comenius was one of
                            many people who tried to reverse this trend. He composed a complete course for learning
                            Latin, covering the entire school curriculum, culminating in his Opera Didactica Omnia,
                            1657.
                            <br>

                            In this work, Comenius also outlined his theory of language acquisition. He is one of the
                            first theorists to write [6] systematically about how languages are learned and about
                            pedagogical methodology for language acquisition. He held that language acquisition must be
                            allied with sensation and experience. Teaching must be oral. The schoolroom should have
                            models of things, and failing that, pictures of them. As a result, he also published the
                            world's first illustrated children's book, Orbis sensualium pictus. The study of Latin
                            diminished from the study of a living language to be used in the real world to a subject in
                            the school curriculum. Such decline brought about a new justification for its study. It was
                            then claimed that its study of Latin developed intellectual ability, and the study of Latin
                            grammar became an end in and of itself.
